# Home Library Service

## Downloading

```
git clone {repository URL}
```

## Open project

```
cd nodejs2023Q2-service
```

## Checkout to develop branch

```
git checkout develop-part3
```

## Installing NPM modules

```
npm install
```

## Use env file

**create .env file and copy-paste lines from .env.example file**

Port is 4000 by default. You can change to another one in .env file

## Running application with docker

To run docker use

```
docker network create home-library-service
```

then start application

```
npm run start:docker
```

and finally apply migration in another terminal (in parallel with docker)

```
npm run db:migrations:apply
```

now you can use app (running tests, call from postman, execute database, etc.)

## Running script for vulnerabilities scanning

About Docker scout: https://github.com/docker/scout-cli

You have to install docker scout from link: https://github.com/docker/scout-cli/releases/tag/v0.22.3 (docker-scout_0.22.3_windows_amd64.zip - for **windows**)

Unpack zip file and copy it in your local CLI plugin directory!!!!!

`%USERPROFILE%\.docker\cli-plugins` on Windows (for me it's C:\Users\Username\\.docker\cli-plugins)

then run:

for api

```
npm run vulnerability-scan:api
```

for db

```
npm run vulnerability-scan:db
```

## Logging

Log level by default is **verbose**, you can change it in .env file (LOG_LEVEL variable).  
If you can see all log levels in console - you can uncomment lines 31-35 in main.js (this is only for easy testing all log levels).

Max size for the log file is **1MB**. You can change it (in MBs) in .env file (LOG_FILE_MAX_SIZE_MB variable).

By default application logs is situated in **/logs** folder. Logs inside docker container has path **/app/logs** in files (make sure your Docker Desktop has the latest version 4.22)

## Postman collection

You can check application using postman collection in **/doc/Home_library_service_with_auth.postman_collection.json** path

## Testing

After application **running** open new terminal and enter:

To run all test with authorization

```
npm run test:auth
```

To run only specific test suite with authorization

```
npm run test:auth -- <path to suite>
```

### Check linter errors:

```
npm run lint
```
